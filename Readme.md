# My Spring Boot Application

This is a REST API developed with Spring Boot for an e-commerce site. The application connects to a MySQL database to manage and handle data related to the e-commerce platform.

## Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- MySQL Server

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Fathedake/backend_e-commerce_spring-boot.git

cd backend_e-commerce_spring-boot

```

To develop an app using the Java language, my favorite IDE is NetBeans. I donâ€™t need to configure anything to run my app, and I can run it easily on Windows. If any packages are missing, it allows me to install them directly within the IDE, and everything works seamlessly.
